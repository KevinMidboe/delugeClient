## <a name="abstract"></a> Abstract
Create a deluge python client for interfacing with deluge for common tasks like listing, adding, removing and setting download directory for torrents. 


## <a name="setup_virtualenv"></a> Setup Virtual Environment
Virtual environment allows us to create a local environment for the requirements needed. Because pip does not download packages already downloaded to your system, we can use virtualenv to save our packages in the project folder.


### <a name="installation"></a> Installation
To install virtualenv, simply run:  

```
 $ pip install virutalenv
```


### Usage
After you have downloaded this project go to it in your terminal by going to the folder you downloaded and typing the following:


```
 $ cd delugeClient/
```

The to setup a virtual environment enter this:

```
 $ virtualenv -p python3.10 env
```

 > If you get an error now it might be because you don't have python3.10, please make sure you have python version 3.10 if else you can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)


First we navigate to the folder we downloaded.

Then we use the ```virtualenv``` command to create a ```env``` subdirectory in our project. This is where pip will download everything to and where we can add other specific python versions. Then we need to *activate* our virtual environment by doing:

```
 $ source env/bin/activate
```

You should now see a ```(env)``` appear at the beginning of your terminal prompt indicating that you are working from within the virtual environment. Now when you install something: 

```
 $ pip install <package>
```

It will get installed in the env folder, and not globaly on our machine. 

The leave our virtual environment run: 

```
 $ deactivate
```


## <a name="configure"></a> Configure the Config File

The following is where we need to do some manual editing of our config file. Open to ```config.ini``` in your favorite text editor. 

``` 
 $ (vi) config.ini
```

Then you need to change the HOST and PORT to reflect the address for your deluged client. The username and password needed to connect can be found under:  

(Only tested on ubuntu)
```
 $ cat /home/USER/.config/deluge/auth
```


## <a name="install"></a> Install Required Dependencies
Now that we have our virutalenv set up and activated we want to install all the necessary packages listed in `requirements.txt`. To install it's dependencies do the following:

```
 $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now we have our neccessary packages installed!
